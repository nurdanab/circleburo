    "description1": "Dive is a brand of cassette and cassette-free blinds, for which we built a social media presence from scratch. The project started at the end of December, and the key task at the first stage was to launch the account, build a basic audience, and test demand through content and advertising.",
    "description2": "We immediately focused on a simple and clear presentation: product explanation, real faces, short formats, and a focus on customer benefits. This allowed us to start gaining views and first subscribers without a long preparatory stage.",
    "description3": "In parallel, the foundation of the account was built. We developed a unified visual style, designed the profile header, adjusted the account name for promotion tasks, and created highlights that addressed the main customer questions: assortment, installation, reasons to choose the brand. As a result, the profile began to look like a full-fledged digital catalog and sales point.",
    "description4": "During the work, we established regular content and publication planning. The content combined educational videos, product presentation, and simple explanations of the ordering and installation process. This allowed us to reach not only subscribers but also a cold audience that was previously unfamiliar with the brand. Additionally, targeted advertising was launched. It provided not only metric growth but also direct response in the form of incoming requests and subscriptions from advertisements.",
    "results": "Dive project result: In a short time, a packaged account was created, content logic was built, formats were tested, and first confirmations of demand were received through reach, views, and advertising responses. The project laid the foundation for further scaling and turning social networks into a stable lead generation channel.",

Circle joined the project with the task of systematically designing the visual part of the product and accompanying materials used in working with corporate clients. It was important to preserve the brand character while making communication more understandable and structured.",
    "description2": "The next stage was the development of the commercial proposal design. The document was structured to clearly and consistently convey the product value, reflecting the style and positioning of the brand.",
    "description3": "Additionally, Circle developed visual solutions for packaging elements. The project included postcards, wrappers, as well as labels for tea and chocolate. All elements were executed in a unified visual style and coordinated with each other so that the packaging was perceived as a complete product.",
    "results": "As a result, Senen received a structured set of visual and printed materials that enhance the product and support the brand at all stages of interaction with corporate clients."

  "homeBank": {
    "title": "Home Bank",
    "description1": "This project was executed as a research and strategic brand diagnostic to understand why the bank does not build trust and how its perception can be changed through rebranding, space, and digital experience.",
    "description2": "Consumer research was chosen as the project foundation. 110 respondents from different cities of Kazakhstan participated in the survey. The analysis showed that 58% of the audience lacks a formed brand perception, and the level of trust is at a critically low level - about 9-12% compared to market leaders. The problem was not active distrust, but the absence of a clear image and experience that could form this trust.",
    "description3": "Customer behavior research revealed a key pattern. Deposits turned out to be the main indicator of long-term relationships with the bank, and the presence of trust increases the probability of choosing deposits by about 30 times. It also turned out that despite the development of online channels, more than 67% of respondents either prefer branches or are willing to interact with them. However, a positive branch visit experience was recorded in less than a third of the audience, except for the group with a high level of trust, where this indicator reached 78%.",
    "description4": "Based on this data, a strategic conclusion was formed. To change brand perception, it is not enough to strengthen communications or promote products. The key factor is experience - physical and digital. Branch space and app interface directly affect the level of trust and customers' readiness for more complex financial products.",
    "description5": "Within the project, an evolutionary rebranding concept under the name HomeBank was proposed. The name and visual system are based on associations with safety, stability, and clarity. The color palette is built around blue as a basic marker of reliability. The interior is considered as a brand tool: a calm environment, clear navigation, and comfort reduce tension and strengthen trust at a subconscious level.",
    "description6": "A separate diagnostic block was dedicated to the mobile application. The analysis showed that with standard functionality, the application does not work on building trust and long-term financial decisions. As a strategic direction, UX improvements and the introduction of financial planning and education tools were proposed, which strengthen the bank's position as a partner, not just a service for operations.",
    "results": "A structured diagnostic model showing how through a combination of research, branding, interior, and digital experience, it is possible to change the bank's perception and create a foundation for trust growth and long-term customer value."
