The main task was to launch the gallery from scratch, building a logical offline environment and creating a digital platform that would become the main tool for presenting the project.",

      "section5": "The website was designed as a key point of contact with the audience. We built the structure and visual logic of the platform so that artists' works were presented consistently and correctly, and the user journey remained clear and easy. The main focus was on navigation, visual presentation, and the absence of unnecessary barriers.",

A separate client request was the creation of creative content ideas that would organically and qualitatively integrate into the existing brand strategy without disrupting its logic and tone.",
      "section3p2": "As part of the collaboration, Circle took full responsibility for managing Campit's Instagram page. We worked with visual style, content structure, and tour presentation, developed creative concepts for publications, and built a content plan so that the authorial travel format, routes, and value of experience were clearly and attractively conveyed from the first touchpoints.",

      "description2": "We immediately bet on simple and clear presentation: product explanation, live faces, short formats, and focus on customer benefit. This allowed us to start gaining views and first subscribers without a long preparatory stage.",
      "section4p1": "In parallel, the foundation of the account itself was built. We developed a unified visual style, designed the profile header, adjusted the account name for promotion tasks, and created highlights that addressed the main customer questions: assortment, installation, reasons to choose the brand. As a result, the profile began to look like a full-fledged digital catalog and sales point.",
      "section4p2": "During the work, we built regular content and publication planning. The content combined educational videos, product presentation, and simple explanations of the ordering and installation process. This allowed us to reach not only subscribers but also cold audiences who were previously unfamiliar with the brand. Additionally, targeted advertising was launched. It gave not only growth in metrics but also direct response in the form of incoming requests and subscriptions from ad announcements.",
      "section5": "By the time the work stage was completed, the account showed measurable results. Over the last 30 days, the profile gained 12,029 views, with about 89% of the audience being non-subscribers, indicating strong reach performance. Reached accounts exceeded 5,600, and the main share of views came from Reels, which confirmed the correctness of the chosen content strategy.",

The project laid the foundation for further scaling and turning social media into a stable lead generation channel."

      "title": "Home Bank",
      "description": "This project was carried out as a research and strategic brand diagnosis to understand why the bank does not build trust and how its perception can be changed through rebranding, space, and digital experience.",
      "section4": "Consumer research was chosen as the basis for the project. The survey involved 110 respondents from different cities in Kazakhstan. The analysis showed that 58% of the audience lacks a formed brand perception, and the trust level is critically low – about 9-12% compared to market leaders. However, the problem was not active distrust, but the absence of a clear image and experience that could form this trust.",
      "section5": "Customer behavior research revealed a key pattern. Deposits turned out to be the main indicator of long-term relationships with the bank, and the presence of trust increases the probability of choosing deposits by about 30 times. It was also found that despite the development of online channels, more than 67% of respondents either prefer branches or are willing to interact with them. However, positive branch visit experience was recorded in less than a third of the audience, except for the group with high trust levels, where this indicator reached 78%.",
      "section6": "Based on this data, a strategic conclusion was formed. To change brand perception, it is not enough to strengthen communications or promote products. The key factor is experience – physical and digital. Branch space and app interface directly affect trust levels and customers' readiness for more complex financial products.",
      "section7": "As part of the project, a concept of evolutionary rebranding under the name HomeBank was proposed. The name and visual system rely on associations with security, stability, and clarity. The color palette is built around blue as a basic marker of reliability. The interior is considered as a brand tool: a calm environment, clear navigation, and comfort reduce tension and enhance trust at a subconscious level.",
      "section8": "A separate diagnostic block was dedicated to the mobile application. The analysis showed that with standard functionality, the app does not work on building trust and long-term financial decisions. As a strategic direction, UX improvements and the introduction of financial planning and education tools were proposed, which strengthen the bank's position as a partner, not just a service for transactions.",
      "resultsText": "A structured diagnostic model showing how through a combination of research, branding, interior, and digital experience, bank perception can be changed and a foundation created for trust growth and long-term customer value."

      "section4": "As part of the project, Circle was engaged in developing interior solutions for various company zones. We worked with spatial logic, visual accents, and design details, ensuring functionality of spaces and compliance with the brand's corporate style. Office and exhibition spaces were considered as elements of a unified visual system supporting the professional and technological image of the company.",
      "section5": "Additionally, Circle developed print materials for offline communications, including posters. The work emphasized clear information structure, visual restraint, and compliance with brand style. Print media complemented the space and enhanced overall brand perception.",

It was important to preserve the brand's character while making communication more understandable and structured.",
      "section4p1": "As part of the collaboration, Circle developed a mini guidebook that helps clients navigate the assortment of gift boxes and their filling options. The material was designed as a practical tool supporting the process of selection and personalization of gifts.",
      "section4p2": "The next stage was the development of commercial proposal design. The document was structured to clearly and consistently convey product value, reflecting the brand's style and positioning.",
      "section5": "Additionally, Circle developed visual solutions for packaging elements. The project included postcards, wrappers, as well as labels for tea and chocolate. All elements were executed in a unified visual key and coordinated with each other so that the packaging was perceived as an integral product.",

This allowed the brand to look cohesive and recognizable at all touchpoints with the audience.",
      "section4p1": "After completing this stage, the client moved to the Cycle package – a monthly support format, within which we continue to develop the project, strengthen the community, and consistently scale communication based on the updated visual and semantic foundation.",
      "section4p2": "We took on work with content, visual presentation, print materials, and offline activities, as well as participated in designing the coffee shop interior, so that space and communication work as a unified whole.",
      "section7": "As part of SMM, we built regular brand presence on Instagram and TikTok, reworked content presentation, and focused on live formats. In September, despite a drop in reach compared to the previous period, we managed to maintain audience activity and record a 9% growth in subscribers compared to August. This stage became diagnostic: we tested formats and found that visual posts and content with offline coffee shop life generate the greatest engagement.",
      "periodSep": "Sep 1 - Sep 30",
      "section8": "We strengthened the strategy and shifted focus towards Reels and Stories, as well as a tighter connection between online and offline. The result – a sharp growth in key metrics: account reach grew by 125.3%, profile actions – by 6.3%, profile visits – by 8.4%. Subscriber growth for the month was almost 12% compared to the end of September. This confirmed that the chosen content model and publication pace began to work systematically.",
      "periodOct": "Oct 1 - Oct 31",
      "section9": "A separate direction was work with the community. We didn't just announce events, but built attraction points around Steppe Coffee. During the collaboration period, connections with existing communities were restored and new ones were attracted – SpacED, Language Mixer, Bookclub Almaty. An art master class was held at the coffee shop, which increased offline traffic and became a content anchor for social media. This format allowed the brand to go beyond 'coffee shop' and establish itself as an urban space for meetings and ideas.",
      "section10": "Additionally, we worked on print material design and interior design, so that the brand's visual language was consistently presented both in the digital environment and in physical space. This enhanced recognition and connected social media communication with guests' real experience.",
      "resultsText": "Steppe Coffee work outcome: Social media became a reflection of the coffee shop's life, offline events began to work as a tool for attracting and retaining audiences, and the brand received a clear and sustainable communication model that can be scaled further."
